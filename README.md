#### Car Renting Website (with enhanced features)


#### Overview

Geographical condition like Arunachal Pradesh or hilly areas where possibility for renting a car is very less. More people will get access to cars whom wish to rent a
car for a trip under a certain price range and at affordable price which will be provided by the customer. People who have car and is not being used can give their car for renting so the car could be easily maintained and they could also earn money. We will provide drivers for those customers who don’t know driving or who opted for driver service. There are not many websites or apps which are being used at such terrains and people often depends on the local markets for renting cars. On occasions like Wedding, Vacation, house shifting, and tour and on many other situations they feel
the necessity of a vehicle to sort out the problems. So if it is possible to design or develop a web based application for availing transport whenever and wherever possible, then it will be beneficial for both renter and transport provider. Now a days, by some clicks only, we can get whatever you want at home. We already know about the online shopping, e-banking etc. Similarly, The Car Rental System is the online facility to book cars online within few clicks only. Some people cannot afford to have a car, for those people this system becomes very helpful. This system includes various cars, as per the customer order and comfort, it place the order and deliver the car as per the location within the area. For travelling a long distance, booking can be done via internet service only.

BASIC WORKING: 
In our dynamic car renting website. If a user send a login request to the website server, user’s data will be automatically retrieved and verified with the info present in our database. If that information matched, user will be redirected to the home page of the website. If the user is a new user, he/she can sign up by submitting the signup form and data will be stored to the database. In home page, user can choose a preferable car type (Luxury or Simple). Car’s list of chosen car type will be shown on the next page. Users have an option to see the car’s list in a sorted price manner (low to high price or vice versa). Searching option will also be provided there so that the user can search a car by its car name. Booking option with each car will be given, and the user can book a car after submitting some booking related details and that details will also be stored in database


#### Technology used

We have designed this project in such a way that it feel’s easy to use by a new user, as like we have created a simple and beautiful user interface which is fully responsive by the help of Bootstrap. This whole project is fully responsive which supports all browser’s and devices. We used JSON objects And AJAX to fasten the processes running on the system (without refreshing of page). Validation (by the help of Javascript) and Authentication is also done for security purpose. Only a valid user can enter and book a car by providing the valid details. We are making the frontend of the project in HTML , CSS and JavaScript  and using Springboot in backend with H2 database which is used for both testing and storing of the data given by the users such as user details and booking details . Springboot  is a java’s framework and a new technology which is currently used in the big MNC’s. A good use of data structures and algorithm is applied in this project for increasing the searching (By name) and sorting of cars (By price) is done.We have used ASR (Automated speech recognition) and provided a command button on homepage. By the click of that button , user can give command like ‘Sort cars’ and the cars will get sort in fractions of second. User can search the car by just calling the car name. After clicking the BOOK NOW button, Car renting form will open. By the successful submission of car form, user can finally book the car.
